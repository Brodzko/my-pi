# .pi Repo Instructions

Before considering any code task done, run `npm run format` and `npm run tsc` in the relevant package and fix all errors. Every package should have these scripts.

When installing `npm` packages, always pin at exact version (no `^` or `~`), prefer latest at the point of installation.

When importing anything from `remeda`, use `import * as R from 'remeda'` to named imports.
